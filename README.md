# 🧠 3D Organ Classification with MedMNIST & PyTorch

This project uses the **OrganMNIST3D** dataset from the [MedMNIST](https://medmnist.com/) collection to perform **3D organ classification** using **PyTorch**.

## Features

- 3D organ classification with deep learning
- Uses the standardized OrganMNIST3D dataset
- Built with PyTorch for flexibility and performance

## 📈 Example Output

- Training progress with live loss curve
- Validation accuracy (e.g., Validation Accuracy: 85.2%)
- optional 2D slice previews of 3D volumes 🧬

## 💡 Next Steps

- Try deeper architectures (e.g., 3D ResNet 🏗️)
- Experiment with data augmentation
- Fine-tune on specific organ subsets
